An attempt at predicting the survivors of the Titanic Disaster based on features such as the Class of the passenger ("Pclass"), whether they were male or female ("Sex"), the number of siblings or spouse of a person aboard the ship ("SibSp") and lastly whether the passenger had parents or children ("Parch").

Note: At the moment, the simple Random Forest Classifier gave the best accuracy possible, which is: 0.78708. The accuracy rose due to the use of the "Embarked, as well as the "Fare" feature, which was imputed by its median values because of some missing data in the column. Some cleanup must still be done and perhaps a LASSO implemented on the features so as to fine tune our algorithm.
