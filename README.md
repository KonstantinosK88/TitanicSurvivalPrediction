An attempt at predicting the survivors of the Titanic Disaster based on features such as the Class of the passenger ("Pclass"), whether they were male or female ("Sex"), the number of siblings or spouse of a person aboard the ship ("SibSp") and lastly whether the passenger had parents or children ("Parch").

Note: At the moment, K-Nearest Neighbours gives the best accuracy of them all (at 0.77751). Tomorrow I shall also try to implement Cross-Validation on the Random Forest Classifier and see how it goes when it performs using the best parameters for its tuning.
